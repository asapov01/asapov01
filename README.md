👋Hello! I'm a member of the https://cpi-tm.com/ team, a Ukrainian crypto community with over 250 members, each developing in their preferred direction.

📌 My main interests in the cryptocurrency world are validation, ambassadorship, contributing, script writing, and active participation in the development of projects we are involved in.

I have participated in many test networks, here are some of them:
🌐Cosmos: Nibiru, Lava Network, Dymension, Zetachain, Babylon, Side Protocol, Union.
🌐Polkadot: Subspace, Gear.
🌐Other blockchains: Over Protocol, EigenLayer, Holograph, Shardeum, Starknet, Penumbra, Fleek Network, Namada, Zora(Conduit)
Mainnet: Pion Network;

Additionally, I write and distribute installation and update instructions within the crypto community, notify about new announcements from projects, and together we explore projects, contribute to them.

📌 Regarding my skills:
• I have extensive experience working with Cosmos network nodes, a comprehensive understanding of node interaction at each stage of installation, and experience participating in other blockchains.
• I'm proficient in Shell, Python programming languages, and have extensive experience using the Linux operating system.
• I can set up full server monitoring using Grafana-Prometheus-Node Exporter, as well as track node status in the network through TenderDuty.
• In my work, I use my own scripts to track any changes that are important to me, with instant notifications sent to my own Telegram bot.
• I write scripts for automatic installation, updates, backup, and any other needs.
